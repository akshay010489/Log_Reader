# Log_Reader
The project was a quick code to read specific lines of a elaborate logging file generated by a machine. The machine performs several physical actions and the log records them with time stamps and duration used.

The code uses an input Log file (Called Run.Log in Line 8 from code start). Generates a CSV file with data.
